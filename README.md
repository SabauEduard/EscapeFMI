# EscapeFMI

### Description:
The game is based on the real life idea of escape rooms, but is set in a horror atmosphere, fuelled by darkness, sudden flashes of light and loud noises, and the constant pressure of the limited time you have to solve the puzzles and the enemies waiting to attack at any moment.
The goal of the game is to escape an abandoned University, called FMI, by successfully navigating a series of rooms, each with its own unique puzzles, while also saving some clues for later challenges.
